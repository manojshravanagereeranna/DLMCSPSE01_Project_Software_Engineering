Abstract

Farm2Kitchen is an innovative web-based platform designed to connect local organic farmers directly with conscious consumers seeking fresh, seasonal, and sustainably produced food. The core concept is to digitalize the organic food supply chain, empowering farmers and enriching the customer experience with personalization, eco impact tracking, and community engagement.  This document outlines the conception phase for the application’s development, detailing the objectives, scope, requirements, chosen methodology, system architecture, and key innovations.


1.	Introduction
Organic farming is gaining momentum globally due to increasing consumer awareness about health, sustainability, and environmental impact. However, the supply chain between organic farmers and end consumers remains inefficient and lacks transparency. Farm2kitchen addresses this gap by offering aa web-based platform for organic farmers to directly list their products, and for consumers to browse, customize, and subscribe to regular deliveries of fresh produce - all while learning about their eco-impact and the farms behind the food.

1.1	Background 
Traditional supply chains introduce inefficiencies, increase carbon emissions, and often disadvantage small-scale farmers. With Farm2Kitchen, the goal is to shorten the supply chain and make the farm-to-fork journey more transparent. The system introduces several innovations:
•	AI-powered crop forecasting based on regional demand
•	Personalized farm box customization with intelligent substitutions
•	Real-time impact tracking and gamification to boost sustainable behaviour

This application will empower farmers and consumers alike while advancing the principles of sustainability and local commerce.

3	Methodology
We are following an Agile (Scrum-inspired) development methodology. The reason for this choice includes:
•	Flexibility to integrate evolving ideas like ML forecasting and gamification.
•	Frequent review cycles for feedback from users (farmers, consumers).
•	Cross-functional task division and sprint-based releases.
Each sprint will last two weeks and deliver a potentially usable feature. Roles include:
•	Scrum Master: Ensures sprint delivery
•	Product Owner: Represents end-user interests
•	Dev Team: Handles coding, design, testing
